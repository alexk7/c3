C3VM:
- Values are abstract entities.
- Types are sets of values.
    - Subset relations can be established between types that specifies safe
      conversions between them.

- Objects are:
    - A type
    - A representation of a value according to the type

- "Concrete" Types are:
    - An underlying native type
    - A type tag (runtime, but should be optimized away most of the time)
        - This allows a language-level description of the stage of construction
          of a C3 object:
            - raw memory
            - constructed (after a constructor is called)
            - return to raw memory (after a destructor is called)

The C3 language builds important additional features that are not part of C3VM:
- type as first class citizen (also: "the type of type is type")
